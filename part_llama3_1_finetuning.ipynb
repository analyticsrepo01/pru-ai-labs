    "This notebook demonstrates finetuning and deploying Llama 3.1 models with Vertex AI. All of the examples in this notebook use parameter efficient finetuning methods [PEFT (LoRA)](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) to reduce training and storage costs. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is one approach of Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), where pretrained model weights are frozen and rank decomposition matrices representing the change in model weights are trained during finetuning.\n",
    "After finetuning, we can deploy models on Vertex with GPU.\n",

    "Use the Vertex AI SDK to create and run the custom training jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses [timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco) dataset as an example.\n",
    "You can set `dataset_name` to any existing [Hugging Face dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets) name, and set `instruct_column_in_dataset` to the name of the dataset column containing training data. The [timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco) has only one column `text`, and therefore we set `instruct_column_in_dataset` to `text` in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Prepare a custom JSONL dataset for finetuning\n",
    "\n",
    "You can prepare a JSONL file where each line is a valid JSON string as your custom training dataset. For example, here is one line from the [timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco) dataset:\n",

    "The JSON object has a key `text`, which should match `instruct_column_in_dataset`; The value should be one training data point, i.e. a string. After you prepared your JSONL file, you can either upload it to [Hugging Face datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "- To upload a JSONL dataset to [Hugging Face datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets), follow the instructions on [Uploading Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/datasets-adding). Then, set `dataset_name` to the name of your newly created dataset on Hugging Face.\n",

    "- To upload a JSONL dataset to [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage), follow the instructions on [Upload objects from a filesystem](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploading-objects).

    "\n",
    "Optionally update the `instruct_column_in_dataset` field below if your JSON objects use a key other than the default `text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Format your data with custom JSON template\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, your dataset might have multiple text columns and you want to construct the training data with a template. You can prepare a JSON template in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"description\": \"Template used by Llama 3.1, accepting text-bison format.\",\n",
    "  \"source\": \"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/tune-text-models-supervised#dataset-format\",\n",

    "  \"response_separator\": \"<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the template above can be used to format the following training data (this line comes from `gs://cloud-samples-data/vertex-ai/model-evaluation/peft_train_sample.jsonl`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\"input_text\":\"TRANSCRIPT: \\nREASON FOR EVALUATION:,\\n\\n LABEL:\",\"output_text\":\"Chiropractic\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example template simply concatenates `input_text` with `output_text` with some special tokens in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "To try such custom dataset, you can make the following changes:\n",
    "1. Set `template` to `llama3-text-bison`\n",
    "1. Set `train_dataset_name` to `gs://cloud-samples-data/vertex-ai/model-evaluation/peft_train_sample.jsonl`\n",

    "1. Set `eval_dataset_name` to `gs://cloud-samples-data/vertex-ai/model-evaluation/peft_eval_sample.jsonl`\n",
    "1. Set `eval_split_name` to `train` (**NOT** `test`)\n",
    "1. Set `instruct_column_in_dataset` as `input_text`."
